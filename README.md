# Algorithms in Javascript

## Merge Sort

### Overview

The First exercice is a merge sort of a list of numbers, in the /Merge.js using /list.txt file.
The program reads a list of numbers from a file, validates them, and sorts them using the Merge Sort algorithm.
It also counts the total number of comparisons made during the sorting process.

### Features

- File input: Read numbers from a text file passed as a command-line argument.
- Validation: Check if the file exists, is not empty, and contains only valid numbers.
- Merge Sort: Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- Comparison counter: Displays the number of comparisons performed.

### How to use

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Place your input numbers in the list.txt file.
3. Run : `node Merge.js list.txt`
